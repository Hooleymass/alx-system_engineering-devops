# The Amazing Journey of a Website: What Happens When You Visit [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com)?

## Introduction:

Have you ever wondered what happens when you type something like [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) in your web browser and press a button to go to a website? It's like a magical adventure behind the screen! Let's take a fun and simple journey together to explore how your request reaches the website and brings back the webpage you want to see!

1. Finding the Website's House: (DNS - Domain Name System)

Imagine the website is like a house, and your browser needs to find its address. It does this by asking a helpful guide called the DNS (Domain Name System). This guide tells your browser the right address (or IP address) where the website's house is located.

2. Knocking on the Website's Door: (TCP/IP)

Once your browser knows the website's address, it knocks on the door (which is like making a connection) to visit the website's house. This knocking is done with special manners called TCP/IP, which helps make sure the visit goes smoothly.

3. Passing Through Security Guards: (Firewalls)

Before your request reaches the website, it has to go through some security guards called firewalls. These guards check the request to make sure everything is safe and secure before letting it in.

4. Having a Secret Talk: (HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, SSL - Secure Sockets Layer)

When you see "https://" in the website's address, it means you want to talk in a secret code. This secret code is like wearing a special invisibility cloak called SSL. It makes sure that no one can understand your conversation except you and the website.

5. Meeting the Friendly Helpers: (Load Balancers)

Sometimes, websites are so busy that they have many helpers to handle all the visitors. These helpers are called load balancers. They make sure everyone gets inside the website's house without anyone feeling crowded or lost.

6. Saying Hello to the Website: (Web Server)

Finally, your request arrives at the website's house, and the website says, "Hello, how can I help you?" This is the web server's job. It listens to your request and gets ready to show you the right webpage.

7. Asking for Special Things: (Application Server)

Some websites are like magic shops with lots of secret treasures. When you ask for something special, the website asks its friend called the application server for help. The application server knows all the magical tricks to find the right answers for you.

8. Finding the Treasure: (Database)

To get what you asked for, the application server goes to the big library called the database. In this library, the website keeps all its special information neatly organized, like a treasure chest full of secret knowledge.

## Conclusion:

And there you have it! You've just been on an exciting adventure through the amazing world of websites. From finding the website's address with the DNS to having secret conversations with HTTPS/SSL, and meeting helpful load balancers and friendly web servers, every step plays an important role in bringing you the webpages you love. So, the next time you visit a website, remember the magical journey that happens behind the screen, making your web surfing so much fun!
